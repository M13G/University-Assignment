Create a program to store data of songs in a database. For each entry the program should store the following data: title of the song, name of the performer (singer or group), title of the album it was released on, year of release, genre of the music (rock, pop, hip-hop, jazz, classical, etc.), length of song (in minutes and seconds). The program should be able to:  load existing database into memory (create a new if there is no database yet), add new song entry to the database, save the database (from the memory) into a file, display all songs of a user selected artist (the user may enter the artist, for example “Lady Gaga”), display all details of the songs of a user selected album (the user may enter the name of the artist and the title of the album), list all songs that were released in a user selected year, list all songs (title, performer, album, release year) of a user selected genre (for example: list all hip-hop songs).
